# Details of the Simulation files

1) trial.ttt - final simulation scene (on our custom model) that contains path planning in the presence of obstacles algorithm. Path is stored in the form of co-ordinates (FINAL VERSION OF COMPLETE ALGORITHM)

2) v2.ttt - simulation scene (on our custom model) that contains path planning in the absence of obstacles. Path is stored in the form of linear/rotation and the distance/angle. (ONLY PATH PLANNING IN THE ABSENCE OF OBSTACLES FINAL VERSION)

3) trial1.ttt - simulation scene (on in built model) that contains path planning in the absence of obstacles. Path is stored in the form of linear/rotation and the distance/angle.

4) basic1.ttt - original simulation scene (on inbuilt model) that contains a slightly bigger version of path planning in the absence of obstacles. Path is stored in the form of direction and the +ve value of distance to be covered in that direction
